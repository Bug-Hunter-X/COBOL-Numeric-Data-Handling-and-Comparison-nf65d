This repository contains a simple COBOL program that highlights a potential numeric handling issue.  The program compares two numeric fields, but the comparison could yield unexpected results if the fields overflow, causing an unhandled exception, unexpected results, or even program termination depending on the specific COBOL compiler and runtime environment. The solution demonstrates improved handling by using a larger data type or explicit range checks.
